Hello again, everyone! Dev guy here! I’m back with some exciting news!
As many of you already know, I’ve begun working on the update for the MapDataEditor tool and a fix for the Download Center. The great news is that I'm now planning to merge everything—MapDataEditor, Download 
Center—into a single, unified program, which will be packaged with an installer using Inno Setup. This is shaping up to be the greatest project I’ve ever created for my beloved game! 

What’s coming in the next version?
1.) A redesigned Welcome screen with additional information.
2.) Live feeds pulled directly from my website, GitHub, and possibly even Discord.
3.) New icons to replace the old ones.
4.) Progress on the *archive manipulator for .box archives is well underway.
5.) A completely revamped Update Center, now integrated with the O3D engine tool and the latest MapDataEditor version.
6.) A much better, more powerful console.

OMS Editor Updates
I'm also working on updates for the OMS Editor:

1.) The syntax highlighter will be fixed.
2.) The suggestion box, already available in MapDataEditor, will finally be implemented.
3.) The Settings form will be updated and improved, including:
4.) Language selector
5.) Theme manager
6.) Syntax checker
7.) The system that loads and creates configuration files will also be improved for better reliability and flexibility.

Current Challenges
Unfortunately, there are still some major challenges I need to overcome before release. One of the most complex tasks is implementing the Box Archive Manager and finding the appropriate icons for it. It’s 
proving to be quite difficult and time-consuming, so I’ll need more time to ensure everything works perfectly.

Thanks for your continued support—I’m really excited about what’s coming next!

Hey everyone! 
Today I’ve just finished updating the native Linux version of the O3D tool — but there’s still a lot to do. Next, I need to update the Windows version of O3D by fixing some bugs, implementing missing features, 
and finishing the porting process. After that, I’ll move on to updating the MapDataEditor tool and porting it to Linux using Qt Creator. Fortunately,  I’ve solved the issues with reading the OPF archive, so now 
we can access the full contents of the PackedProject.opf file. This will make using the assets much easier in the MapDataEditor as well.

More updates coming soon!

2025.03.31, 19:33:
Hello, everyone! 
I've started working on fixes for V 1.2.3 RC3! I've resolved almost all the OPF archive-related issues. Now, you can extract the archive without any problems! For the classes section files, my program can now 
extract them into their correct directories! I hope to apply the same fix for the image files as well.

2025.03.24, 22:05:
Version V. 1.2.3 RC3 is out on Reshax, Moddb and on our Discord server! You can download the latest version of the tool on www.theoutforce.hu website.

2025.03.17, 21:32:
Hello, everyone! 
I'm getting closer to releasing the latest version of the O3D engine tool with bug fixes and new features! Additionally, I would like to announce that I have started working on the native Linux version of my 
tools (O3D + I/A Vision tool). The I/A Vision tool is not part of the Outforce project, but it is specifically designed for games developed by Interactive Vision. More information can be found on my website.

I will also update the GitHub files and start a repository for Linux. My tools, updates, and fixes will be uploaded there as well!

2025.02.04, 23:05:
Hello, you guys again! 
Today I brought some good new for you! I managed to fix almost all the archive extraction - creation-related issues, so I'M getting closer to release version 1.2.3 RC2! In addition, I have fully implemented 
the Minitray, MapDataEditor tool, fixed plenty issues, cleaned the code, so the program runs smoother! Syntax Checker is now implemented in O3D tool too with fixed and adjusted functions that will be added in 
the MapDataEditor tool too! For more information, please visit my website: www.theoutforce.hu recently as well as my Reshax account!

Project improvements:
I finally managed to implement a console for the program, as well as added SuggestionBox, ToolTip, SyntaxChecker and fixed Highlighter for the OMSEDITOR! I also implemented a Theme manager, which allows you to 
activate the Dark, Light or the Default theme mode for the forms! I have removed the vast of groupboxes, and added splitContainers. Also improved the settings form with the theme manager (language selection, 
box-building method and more will be added soon!). [MapDataEditor:] I promised you that I'm working on a tool that allows you to edit, create MapData.box archives and the files inside faster. Now the tool is 
still in development status, but at least operational! More info on the website: www.theoutforce.hu. [Knowing issues]: I know about the issues that will be fixed in the next update. More info soon!

Project improvements:
Finally, I managed to fix the treeView-related node(s) (folder(s), and childnode(s) (subfolder(s) issues. You can create *.box archives that contains file(s) folder(s) and 
subfolder(s)! You can also remove all the items (files) you added in the treeView components, remove selected file and / or the selected folder(s) or subfolder(s) too! 
I also improved BoxBuilder with a richTextBox component which will warn you anytime if a file is missiong or an error occured, and you can see what file(s) and folder(s) or 
subfolder(s) you have created and created the archive well! The only part of this code that will be fixed and improved the MapData editor mode. More info soon. Stay tuned, Cadets!

2024.10.08, 15:21:
Project Improvements:
I have almost finished the implementation of the BoxBuilder tab, and added a MapData.box checker. It will be useful, if you want to design Skirmish maps. It will warn you 
if you forgot to add some necessary file(s) for your new skirmish archive.

2024.10.03, 17:33:
Project improvements:
Hello, guys again! I started to implement the New project form, which will allow you to make folders and subfolders (nodes and childnodes) if you want to make a new *.box 
archive. This program is much more powerful than my previous tools! Also working on a fix for the Outforce Download Center regarding the SSPI-related issue.

Localisation: Hungarian!
Hello, you guys, this article is only in Hungarian.
A mai nappal elkezdtem a teljes magyarnyelvű lokalizációt elkészíteni. Minden szöveget le fogok magyarra fordítani a játékban. Ha az megvan, akkor jönnek a küldetések, 
jelenleg a Tutorialt fordítom, a demo mappal már végeztem is! Aztán jönnek a kampány mappok! Ha az megvan, megnézem, mégis mi a náthás picsát tudnék csinálni a GUI-val is! 
Mára ennyi. Ja, és olvasd a weblapunkat: www.theoutforce.hu!
