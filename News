Hello, you guys again! Today I brought some good new for you! I managed to fix almost all the archive extraction - creation-related issues, so I'M
getting closer to release version 1.2.3 RC2! In addition, I have fully implemented the Minitray, MapDataEditor tool, fixed plenty issues, cleaned 
the code, so the program runs smoother! Syntax Checker is now implemented in O3D tool too with fixed and adjusted functions that will be added in
the MapDataEditor tool too! For more information, please visit my website: www.theoutforce.hu recently as well as my Reshax account!

Project improvements:
I finally managed to implement a console for the program, as well as added SuggestionBox, ToolTip, SyntaxChecker and fixed Highlighter for the 
OMSEDITOR! I also implemented a Theme manager, which allows you to activate the Dark, Light or the Default theme mode for the forms! I have removed
the vast of groupboxes, and added splitContainers. Also improved the settings form with the theme manager (language selection, box-building method
and more will be added soon!). 
[MapDataEditor:] I promised you that I'm working on a tool that allows you to edit, create MapData.box archives and the files inside faster. Now the
tool is still in development status, but at least operational! More info on the website: www.theoutforce.hu.
[Knowing issues]: I know about the issues that will be fixed in the next update. More info soon! Stay tuned!

Project improvements:
Finally, I managed to fix the treeView-related node(s) (folder(s), and childnode(s) (subfolder(s) issues. You can create *.box archives that contains
file(s) folder(s) and subfolder(s)! You can also remove all the items (files) you added in the treeView components, remove selected file and / or the
selected folder(s) or subfolder(s) too! I also improved BoxBuilder with a richTextBox component which will warn you anytime if a file is missiong or
an error occured, and you can see what file(s) and folder(s) or subfolder(s) you have created and created the archive well! The only part of this
code that will be fixed and improved the MapData editor mode. More info soon. Stay tuned, Cadets!

Project Improvements:
I have almost finished the implementation of the BoxBuilder tab, and added a MapData.box checker. It will be useful, if you want to design Skirmish maps.
It will warn you if you forgot to add some necessary file(s) for your new skirmish archive.

Project improvements:
Hello, guys again! I started to implement the New project form, which will allow you to make folders and subfolders (nodes and childnodes) if you want to
make a new *.box archive. This program is much more powerful than my previous tools! Also working on a fix for the Outforce Download Center regarding the
SSPI-related issue.

Localisation: Hungarian!
Hello, you guys, this article is only in Hungarian.
A mai nappal elkezdtem a teljes magyarnyelvű lokalizációt elkészíteni. Minden szöveget le fogok magyarra fordítani a játékban. Ha az megvan, akkor jönnek 
a küldetések, jelenleg a Tutorialt fordítom, a demo mappal már végeztem is!
Aztán jönnek a kampány mappok! Ha az megvan, megnézem, mégis mi a náthás picsát tudnék csinálni a GUI-val is! Mára ennyi. 
Ja, és olvasd a weblapunkat: www.theoutforce.hu!
