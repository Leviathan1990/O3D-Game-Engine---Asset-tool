Project Improvements.
I have almost finished the implementation of the BoxBuilder tab, and added a MapData.box checker. It will be useful, if you want to design Skirmish maps.
It will warn you if you forgot to add some necessary file(s) for your new skirmish archive.

Project improvements.
Hello, guys again! I started to implement the New project form, which will allow you to make folders and subfolders (nodes and childnodes) if you want to
make a new *.box archive. This program is much more powerful than my previous tools! Also working on a fix for the Outforce Download Center regarding the
SSPI-related issue.

Localisation: Hungarian!
Hello, you guys, this article is only in Hungarian.
A mai nappal elkezdtem a teljes magyarnyelvű lokalizációt elkészíteni. Minden szöveget le fogok magyarra fordítani a játékban. Ha az megvan, akkor jönnek 
a küldetések, jelenleg a Tutorialt fordítom, a demo mappal már végeztem is!
Aztán jönnek a kampány mappok! Ha az megvan, megnézem, mégis mi a náthás picsát tudnék csinálni a GUI-val is! Mára ennyi. 
Ja, és olvasd a weblapunkat: www.theoutforce.hu!
