// Introduce
This program was designed for the asset container archives (*.box and *.opf).
With this tool you can access the contents of these archives, extract them, build
them.

There are two ways for extraction: Selected file, and multiple (entire archive).

You can open images, scriptfiles via my tool stored in the archive with out any
extraction. Furthermore, you can export the script files too and use them in your
- for example- new maps.

Regarding script files you can read, edit and save them at specific destination.

More information in the documentation.pdf file.
